# WinD3D12
WinD3D12 is a WinRT app, that will be using topmost modern technologies, for graphics this one will be using WebGPU, first platform for which will be DirectX12

# Promise
This application is a simple 3D renderer with infrastructure derived from WinD3D, which ultimately allows to separate infrastructure from current backend. WebGPU, as well as WinRT are not yet standards in full power, so this release may be unstable at times and some features may be unavailable.

# Installation
This installation guide is temporary and will change when I'll have time for cmake
1) clone repo
2) in a folder WinD3D12/WinD3D12/ there's a .rar archive with wgpu libs
3) unpack it into WinD3D12/x64/Debug

for now it works only in debug mode
